# User Instructions for Frontend UI

## Overview

The frontend UI is designed to provide an intuitive and interactive dashboard for visualizing the system and network activity data collected by the network agent. The UI is developed using React and Chakra UI and features responsive line charts for CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic.

## Accessing the Frontend UI

The frontend UI is deployed on Netlify and can be accessed at the following URL:
[Frontend UI on Netlify](http://your-netlify-url)

## Navigating the UI

1. **Dashboard**: The main dashboard displays various system metrics, including CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic. Each metric is visualized using responsive line charts that update in real-time.

2. **CPU Usage**: The CPU usage chart shows the percentage of CPU utilization over time. This helps you monitor the system's processing load and identify any spikes in usage.

3. **Memory Usage**: The memory usage chart displays the amount of memory being used by the system. It includes information on total memory, available memory, and memory usage percentage.

4. **Network Traffic**: The network traffic chart provides insights into the amount of data being sent and received by the system. It helps you monitor network activity and detect any unusual patterns.

## Interpreting the Data

- **CPU Usage**: High CPU usage may indicate that the system is under heavy load or running resource-intensive applications. Consistently high CPU usage could be a sign of performance issues.

- **Memory Usage**: Monitoring memory usage helps you ensure that the system has enough available memory to run applications smoothly. High memory usage may lead to slow performance or system crashes.

- **Network Traffic**: Analyzing network traffic can help you identify potential security threats, such as unauthorized data transfers or unusual network activity. It also helps you monitor the system's network performance.

## Troubleshooting

- **UI Not Loading**: Ensure that you have a stable internet connection and that the Netlify URL is correct. If the issue persists, check the browser console for any error messages.

- **Data Not Updating**: Verify that the network agent is running and collecting data. Ensure that the HTTP server serving the JSON data is running and accessible.

- **Chart Display Issues**: If the charts are not displaying correctly, try refreshing the page. If the issue persists, check the browser console for any error messages and ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed.
