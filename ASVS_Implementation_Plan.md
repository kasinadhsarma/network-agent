# ASVS Implementation Plan for Network Security Agent

## Introduction
This document outlines the implementation of the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) requirements for the development of the network security agent. The ASVS provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring the security of web applications and services. By adhering to these standards, the network security agent will be developed with a strong security posture, addressing potential vulnerabilities and ensuring robust protection of system and network activity data.

## Environment Variable Setup

### Setting the SECRET_KEY

To ensure the security of the network agent, the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable must be set before running the script. This key is used for HMAC authentication to ensure the integrity of the collected data.

#### Steps to Set the SECRET_KEY

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Generate a secure `SECRET_KEY` using a command-line tool or password manager. For example, you can use the following command to generate a random 32-character key:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
   Copy the generated key.

3. Set the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable using the following command:
   ```bash
   export SECRET_KEY="your_generated_secret_key"
   ```
   Replace `"your_generated_secret_key"` with the key you generated in the previous step.

4. Verify that the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable is set correctly by running:
   ```bash
   echo $SECRET_KEY
   ```

5. To make the `SECRET_KEY` persistent across system reboots and sessions, add the export command to your shell's profile file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`):
   ```bash
   echo 'export SECRET_KEY="your_generated_secret_key"' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```
   Replace `"your_generated_secret_key"` with the key you generated.

6. For users with different shell environments, such as `zsh` or `fish`, add the export command to the appropriate profile file:
   - For `zsh`:
     ```bash
     echo 'export SECRET_KEY="your_generated_secret_key"' >> ~/.zshrc
     ```
   - For `fish`:
     ```fish
     set -Ux SECRET_KEY your_generated_secret_key
     ```

7. To rotate the `SECRET_KEY` securely:
   - Generate a new secure key using the command from step 2.
   - Update the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable with the new key in your shell's profile file.
   - Restart the network agent script to use the new key.

8. Run the network agent script:
   ```bash
   ./network_agent.py
   ```

#### Best Practices for SECRET_KEY Management

- Keep the `SECRET_KEY` confidential and do not share it with unauthorized individuals.
- Store the `SECRET_KEY` in a secure location, such as a key vault or password manager.
- Rotate the `SECRET_KEY` periodically and update the environment variable accordingly.
- Ensure that the `SECRET_KEY` is not hardcoded in the source code or configuration files.

By following these steps and best practices, you ensure that the `SECRET_KEY` is securely set and the network agent can generate HMACs for data integrity.

## Development Process and Security Measures

### Data Collection
The network agent collects system and network activity data, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, network statistics, and active connections. The data is collected using the `psutil` library for system metrics and the `socket` library for network data.

### HMAC Generation
To ensure the integrity of the collected data, the network agent generates an HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) for each data collection cycle. The HMAC is generated using the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable, which must be securely set before running the script. The HMAC is included in the JSON file along with the collected data.

### Environment Variable Configuration
The `SECRET_KEY` environment variable is used for HMAC generation. It must be set to a secure value before running the network agent script. Instructions for setting the `SECRET_KEY` are provided in the "Environment Variable Setup" section of this document.

### Data Retention Strategy
To prevent overwriting historical data, the network agent creates a new JSON file with a unique timestamp for each data collection cycle. The timestamp is included in the filename, ensuring that each file is unique and preserving historical data for analysis and troubleshooting.

### Error Handling
The network agent includes exception handling for all data collection functions and file operations. Errors are logged without interrupting the script's execution, ensuring that the agent continues to collect data even if some functions encounter issues.

### Logging
The network agent uses the `logging` module to log important events, such as the start of the data collection process, successful generation of HMAC, and any errors that occur during execution. The logs provide valuable information for monitoring the agent's performance and troubleshooting issues.

By following these development processes and security measures, the network agent ensures the secure and reliable collection of system and network activity data.
